Given 2 integer matrices of size n*n (where n is a multiple of 2), multiply
them using each of the three methods:

1. Classic Multiplication
    - The naive approach to multiplication
2. Divide-and-Conqur Multiplication
    - Divide the original matrix down until it is 2x2 then perform classic
3. Strassen Multiplication
    - Divide the original matrix down and perform Strassen multiplication
